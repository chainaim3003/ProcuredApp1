├─ Checks spending limit ($100k) ✅ IMPLEMENTED
├─ Creates PO on Stellar smart contract ✅ IMPLEMENTED
└─ Events emitted: "po_created" ✅ IMPLEMENTED
```

├─ Verifies John's ECR credential (authority to spend) ✅ IMPLEMENTED
└─ Decides to accept or reject ✅ IMPLEMENTED
```

### ✅ **Step 3: SELLER ACCEPTS PURCHASE ORDER**
```
├─ Jane authenticates with Passkey ✅ IMPLEMENTED
├─ Verifies Jane's ECR credential (Contract Signer) ✅ IMPLEMENTED
├─ Checks max contract value ($500k) ✅ IMPLEMENTED
├─ Updates PO status to "Accepted" ✅ IMPLEMENTED
└─ Events emitted: "po_accepted" ✅ IMPLEMENTED
```

### ✅ **Step 4: SELLER FULFILLS ORDER**
```
├─ Jane marks order as fulfilled ✅ IMPLEMENTED
├─ Optionally uploads proof of delivery (IPFS hash) ✅ IMPLEMENTED
├─ Updates PO status to "Fulfilled" ✅ IMPLEMENTED
└─ Events emitted: "po_fulfilled" ✅ IMPLEMENTED
```

### ✅ **Step 5: BUYER RELEASES PAYMENT (X402)**
```
├─ John reviews fulfillment ✅ IMPLEMENTED
├─ Initiates X402 payment ✅ IMPLEMENTED
│  ├─ Client requests payment requirements (402 Payment Required) ✅ IMPLEMENTED
│  ├─ Creates X-PAYMENT header with signed payload ✅ IMPLEMENTED
│  ├─ Facilitator verifies signature ✅ IMPLEMENTED
│  ├─ Facilitator settles USDC payment on Stellar ✅ IMPLEMENTED
│  └─ Returns X-PAYMENT-RESPONSE with tx hash ✅ IMPLEMENTED
├─ Smart contract updated to "Paid" status ✅ IMPLEMENTED
└─ Events emitted: "po_paid" ✅ IMPLEMENTED
```

### ✅ **Step 6: SETTLEMENT COMPLETE**
```
├─ Jane receives USDC instantly (~5 seconds) ✅ IMPLEMENTED
├─ Invoice automatically reconciled on-chain ✅ IMPLEMENTED
├─ Both parties have immutable audit trail ✅ IMPLEMENTED
└─ vLEI credentials provide regulatory compliance ✅ IMPLEMENTED
```
