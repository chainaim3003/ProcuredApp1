### 🎯 **Demo Scenarios**

#### **Scenario 1: Basic Procurement Flow**
1. TechCorp (Buyer) creates PO for $5,000 software services
2. SupplierCo (Seller) accepts the order
3. SupplierCo fulfills the order
4. TechCorp releases payment
5. Transaction complete with full audit trail

#### **Scenario 2: Credential Verification**
1. View credential verification for both parties
2. See QVI → OOR → ECR credential chain
3. Verify spending limits and role authorities
4. Understand vLEI compliance structure

#### **Scenario 3: Role Management**
1. Switch between buyer and seller roles
2. See different UI elements for each role
3. Experience role-specific workflows
4. Understand permission boundaries
